# Use MQTT for Raspberry Pi

The purpose of this code is to transfer data from one Raspberry Pi to another Raspberry Pi in wireless. All Raspberry Pi's must be in one network. The transmitter needs to know the IP address of the receiver. 

Actually, to achieve this goal, one simple method is to use socket. 

I chose to use MQTT since it could be easily applied to multiple devices.
